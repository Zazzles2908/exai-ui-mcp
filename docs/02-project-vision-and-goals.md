# Project Vision & Goals

## Vision Statement

**Transform the EXAI UI MCP project into a comprehensive native web application that provides users with direct, intuitive access to all EXAI capabilities through a modern, workflow-centric interface—eliminating the need for users to understand MCP protocol or use CLI tools.**

## Core Objectives

### 1. Native EXAI Integration
**Goal:** Direct integration with EXAI backend services, not through MCP protocol abstraction.

**Current State:**
```
User → Web UI → WebSocket → External MCP Server → EXAI → AI Models
```

**Target State:**
```
User → Web UI → Next.js API → EXAI Backend → AI Models
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced latency (fewer hops)
- Better error handling
- Direct access to EXAI features
- No dependency on external MCP server
- Full control over user experience

### 2. Workflow-Centric Design
**Goal:** Provide specialized interfaces for each EXAI tool type, optimized for their specific workflows.

**EXAI Tools to Support:**
- **chat** - General collaborative thinking and Q&A
- **thinkdeep** - Multi-stage investigation and reasoning
- **planner** - Sequential task planning
- **consensus** - Multi-model consensus workflow
- **debug** - Root cause analysis
- **analyze** - Code analysis workflow
- **codereview** - Comprehensive code review
- **precommit** - Pre-commit validation
- **secaudit** - Security audit workflow
- **docgen** - Documentation generation
- **refactor** - Refactoring analysis
- **tracer** - Code tracing workflow
- **testgen** - Test generation
- **challenge** - Critical analysis tool

**Each tool requires:**
- Custom UI components
- Workflow state management
- Progress tracking
- Continuation handling
- Result visualization

### 3. User-Centric Experience
**Goal:** Make EXAI accessible to all users, regardless of technical expertise.

**Key Principles:**
- **Intuitive:** No need to understand MCP protocol or CLI commands
- **Visual:** Rich UI for complex workflows
- **Guided:** Step-by-step assistance for multi-stage tools
- **Persistent:** Save and resume conversations/workflows
- **Collaborative:** Share workflows and results with team members

### 4. Enterprise-Ready Platform
**Goal:** Build a production-ready application suitable for team and enterprise use.

**Requirements:**
- **Authentication:** Secure user management with NextAuth.js
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control
- **Multi-tenancy:** Support for multiple organizations
- **Audit logging:** Track all user actions
- **Data persistence:** PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- **Scalability:** Handle concurrent users and workflows
- **Security:** Industry-standard security practices

## Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, reveal complexity as needed. New users see basic chat interface, advanced users access full tool capabilities.

### 2. Workflow-First
Design around user workflows, not technical implementation. Each tool should guide users through its specific process.

### 3. Feedback & Transparency
Always show what's happening. Display progress for long-running operations, explain AI reasoning, show confidence levels.

### 4. Flexibility & Control
Provide sensible defaults but allow customization. Users should be able to configure models, parameters, and preferences.

### 5. Performance & Responsiveness
Fast initial load, optimistic updates, background processing. Never block the UI for long operations.

2. **Not a general-purpose AI chat** - Focused on EXAI tools and workflows
3. **Not a code editor** - Integrates with existing editors, doesn't replace them
4. **Not a project management tool** - Assists with development, not full PM features
5. **Not open to public** - Enterprise/team-focused, not consumer product
